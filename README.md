# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor Homework Exercise 1

This website was given to me to refactor, updating tags to make the website more semantic, giving the html a logical flow and adding comments to make the code easier to read and debug/ update when necessary.

## Objective 

This project was given to me by Heriseon Inc. They wanted me to update there website to follow accessibility standards and optimize for search engines.

## Criteria

Horiseon wanted the following items updated:

    - Semantic HTML elements (changing many of the tags from div into a semantic tag)
    - A logical Structure to the HTML and CSS Files
    - Updating Alt tags for all images 
    - Correct heading Sequencing 
    - Concise descriptive title
    - Adding lots of comments to make the document more readable, organized and easier to format or update


## End Result

After updating the code to reflect both more semantic elements and a more semantic flow, i believe i have achieved the clients desired result. I post this to gitHub in hopes of feedback that will allow me to better myself in the way i have coded anything and allow me to focus on any areas where i can improve or learn
